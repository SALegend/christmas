    <h1>Christmas Celebration in INDIA</h1>
    <p>
        Christmas is celebrated in India by a small minority of the population, primarily by Christians. The celebration of Christmas in India is similar to that in other countries, with people attending church services, exchanging gifts, and participating in other traditional holiday activities. In some parts of India, such as Goa, Christmas is a public holiday, and there may be special events and celebrations held in honor of the occasion. In other parts of the country, Christmas may be celebrated more quietly, with people gathering with friends and family to exchange gifts and share a meal.
